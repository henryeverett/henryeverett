						<h2 class="section-heading about">About me</h2>
						<p>I am an iOS developer with an insatiable passion for beautiful and intuitive mobile applications. I strongly believe that a good mobile app is a combination of sturdy, tested code and a beautiful interface rooted in user-centred design principles. I push myself to make each project better than the last and I strive to learn more about my field each day.
	I thrive in an environment which gives me the freedom to collaborate and become involved with the entire development process in order to produce an engaging and delightful experience for the end user. I have over 4 years of industry involvement working both in a team and solo as a freelancer. I am also experienced in App Store deployment and release management as well as REST and networking practices.</p>
						<p>I stay active within the local tech community - often attending meetups and hack nights. I enjoy learning and working with new technologies and practices and I willingly embrace change. While my first love is iOS, I am exremely flexible and can fit into a large variety of roles if needed such as design, web development and UX.</p>
						<p>
						In my personal life I love travel, cycling, reading, hiking, cooking, music, coffee and cats! I took 10 months out in 2013 to travel the world, visiting and living in South East Asia, Australasia, Fiji and the USA.

						<h2 class="section-heading experience">Experience</h2>

						<h3>Director, Squidshaped - 2014-present</h3>
						<p>I registered a limited company named Squidshaped in which I have personally built and released projects including Moonlit, a local music event calendar and Pixel Burger; an addictive burger-stacking game which received <a href="http://www.gamezebo.com/2014/07/11/pixel-burger-review-works-animal-style-everything/" target="_blank">glowing reviews</a> from the mobile gaming press.</p>

						<h3>Freelancing - 2009-present</h3>
						<p>I offer my services as a freelancer in both iOS and web development and have worked with a wide range of clients on various project types from web design and development to iOS development. I have gained a great deal of experience with client relations and product development lifecycles through this role from conception to launch and beyond.</p>

						<h3>Developer, Deep Blue Sky - 2009-2013</h3>
						<p>Starting as part of the web team before carving myself a niche in iOS development, I was a core member of Bath-based digital agency Deep Blue Sky. I was responsible for the upkeep of a selection of client websites and was the project lead on all iOS applications. My most notable work within the company was my contribution to twiDAQ, a fantasy stock-trading game. I was the lead developer on the iPhone app and was closely involved with the conception and design of many of twiDAQ's features and gameplay scenarios.</p>

							<h2>Pixel Burger</h2>
							<p>My first foray into indie game development, I created a simple-but-oh-so-fun physics based burger stacking game called Pixel Burger. Built on Apple's Sprite Kit framework and available for both iPhone and iPad, the game encourages you to stack an array of crazy ingredients as high as you possibly can without it cascading to the floor. All gameplay, art and assets were created solely by me. </p>

								It's the perfect one-minute, pick-up-and-play game, except we've been playing it all day.

							<h2>Moonlit</h2>
							<p>Built over the course of a weekend, Moonlit is a local events app for Bristol, UK. It displays details about upcoming music, comedy, art and film events pulled from a small Rails-based API and allows users to save them to their iPhone's calendar.</p>
