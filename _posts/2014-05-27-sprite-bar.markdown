Ever wanted to be able to draw your own progress bar? Of course you have! Well SpriteBar is the answer to your prayers!

Ok, ok. It's just a small library for Sprite Kit, but it is pretty nifty. It allows you to pass in a texture atlas of progress bar frames (It took me a few seconds to create the default one in the picture below) and run them as a progress bar. The SpriteBar class is a subclass of SKSpriteNode so it will fit in really easily with your Sprite Kit project. It even features a timer function!

The library and its usage instructions can be found on the GitHub repository below:
