When I was a young boy, I loved video games. My most-loved titles were Sonic the Hedgehog, Mario and The Legend of Zelda. I remember fondly the excitement of getting a new game and slotting in that brand new cartridge. I used to dream of one day making my own game. I would sketch out levels on paper and imagine that I was playing them. 20 years later and I'm now a web/iOS developer looking for a project to work on. I have decided to tap into my inner child and make that game I always wanted to. With no previous game development experience, it's going to be a long battle but I have started by making three important decisions about this game, the rest is subject to change as I go:

- Decision one: The game will be a side-scrolling platform adventure.
- Decision two: The game will initially be written exclusively for iPhone.
- Decision three: The game will be fun, easy to control and of a high standard.

This series of posts will be a diary of my progress as the game's development progresses. As it happens, I have made a start already. So far I have thrown a bunch of code into one class as I feel my way around Apple's new Sprite Kit framework and the fundamentals of programming a platform game.

So far, I have implemented a rudimentary gravity and sideways movement system. After a few hours of bashing my head against the keyboard, a square falls from it's starting position and is able to be shifted left and right by using the arrows keys of my keyboard before disappearing off the bottom of the screen. Not very fun so far but hey it's a start. I will migrate to touch controls at some point later.
